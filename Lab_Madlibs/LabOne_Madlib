A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away....

It is a period of civil war. {your_name}
striking from a hidden
base {output_one} miles away, has won his first victory
against the evil Galactic Empire.

During the battle, {friend_name} managed
to steal {array_adj[1]} secret plans to the Empire's
ultimate weapon, the Death Star, a
{array_adj[0]} space station with enough {array_adj[2]}
power to destroy an entire planet.

Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents,
{your_name} races home aboard the
starship, custodian of the stolen plans
that can save her people and restore
freedom to the galaxy...
